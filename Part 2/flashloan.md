# Flashloan Attacks in DeFi: Real-Life Examples

## 1. The Beanstalk Farms Exploit (2023)

**Overview:**
Beanstalk Farms, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project, fell victim to a flashloan attack resulting in a $182 million loss. The attack exploited Beanstalk's governance system, allowing the attacker to manipulate voting power.

**Flashloan Dynamics:**
Utilizing a flash loan from Aave, the attacker borrowed nearly $1 billion to gain a 67 percent voting stake in Beanstalk Farms.

**Swift Execution and Profit:**
The attacker's manipulation, from borrowing to code execution, took less than 13 seconds, resulting in a net profit of around $80 million.

**Post-Exploit Fallout:**
Beanstalk Farms acknowledged the attack, but immediate recovery seemed unlikely. The BEAN stablecoin's value dropped significantly, trading at around 14 cents instead of its $1 peg.

**Lessons Learned:**
The incident emphasizes the importance of security audits in DeFi projects, addressing flash loan attacks and potential governance vulnerabilities.

## 2. Jimbos Protocol Flash Loan Attack (2023)

**Attack Details:**
Jimbos Protocol, a DeFi app, suffered a flash loan attack just days after launching its supposedly more secure second version. Attackers stole 4,090 ETH tokens worth $7.5 million.

**Protocol Vulnerability:**
Exploiting a slippage control oversight, the attackers borrowed 10,000 ETH in a flash loan and manipulated the app's liquidity pool operations.

**Post-Attack Response:**
Jimbos Protocol initially negotiated with the attackers but, receiving no response, turned to law enforcement and engaged with security experts to track down the culprits.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Lack of a security audit and oversight in slippage control contributed to the vulnerability that was exploited in the V2 software.

**Lessons Learned:**
The incident underscores the importance of security audits, addressing DeFi security challenges, and continually updating measures to counter fast-paced market risks.

In the evolving landscape of decentralized finance, these attacks highlight the critical need for robust security measures, audits, and ongoing vigilance to safeguard users' funds.
